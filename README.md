# SQL-Data-Exploration-Project

This is a umbrella project to explore data and a SQL training for myself.

The Datasets that I used:

covid_exploration > [ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

NashvilleHousing.sql > [github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Project](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx)
